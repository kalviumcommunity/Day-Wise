## **System Prompt Design (Using RTFC Framework)**

### **System Prompt**

```
You are DayWise, an AI Personal Assistant.
ROLE: Your role is to be a digital helper for life planning, health tracking, and budgeting.
TASK: Help users by creating schedules, giving wellness tips, and suggesting budgeting strategies.
FORMAT: Respond in clear, simple bullet points or structured schedules.
CONSTRAINTS: If the user asks anything outside your scope, reply with:
"I'm designed only to help with planning, health, and budgeting."
```

### **RTFC Breakdown**

* **R (Role):** Defined as “DayWise, a personal assistant”
* **T (Task):** Limited to planning, health, and budgeting only
* **F (Format):** Responses must be in clear lists/schedules for easy understanding
* **C (Constraints):** Politely decline if asked about unrelated topics

---

## **Zero-Shot Prompting**

**Zero-shot prompting** is when we give the AI a query **without any examples**.
The AI relies only on its training and the **system prompt instructions** to generate the response.

In **DayWise**, zero-shot prompting is applied when users directly ask for help, such as *“Plan my day”* or *“Track my expenses.”*
The system prompt (built with RTFC) ensures the AI stays **focused on planning, health, and budgeting**, even without extra examples.

This makes DayWise reliable for **first-time users** and ensures consistent guidance.

---

## **Multi-Shot Prompting**

**Multi-shot prompting** means providing the AI with **multiple examples of inputs and outputs** before asking the actual query.
This helps the AI understand the **style, structure, and context** we expect in its answers.

In **DayWise**, multi-shot prompting is used when we want the AI to give **consistent responses across different categories** (planning, health, budgeting).

By giving multiple demonstrations in the prompt, the AI learns the **pattern of responses** and follows the same structured style for new queries.

This ensures **accuracy, consistency, and reliability** in DayWise’s guidance.

---

## **Dynamic Prompting**

**Dynamic prompting** means **modifying the prompt in real-time** based on the user’s context, preferences, or data stored in the system.
Instead of using a fixed instruction, the system **injects user-specific information** into the prompt before sending it to the AI.

In **DayWise**, dynamic prompting is used to give **personalized responses**. For example:

* If a user has logged **5 hours of sleep**, the prompt dynamically includes that info → AI suggests “Try increasing your sleep by 2 hours.”
* If monthly expenses show **high spending on food**, the prompt includes that → AI responds with “Consider reducing eating out to save 15%.”
* If tasks are pending, the system prompt dynamically lists them → AI suggests a schedule including those tasks.

This way, the AI doesn’t just rely on general rules but **adapts its answers to the user’s real-time data**, making the assistant more practical and intelligent.

## **Chain-of-Thought Prompting (Hidden/Silent Reasoning)**

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to perform internal, step-by-step reasoning before producing an answer.
To keep responses concise and to avoid exposing sensitive intermediate reasoning, DayWise uses a safe pattern: the model reasons internally but only outputs the final plan.

### **Chain-of-Thought–Inspired Prompt (Safe)**

```
Apply internal step-by-step reasoning to plan and verify a feasible day.
Do not reveal your intermediate reasoning or calculations.

Follow this internal sequence silently:
1) Collect constraints (calendar events, priorities, health targets, budget limits)
2) Allocate realistic time blocks and buffer time
3) Check conflicts and adjust
4) Add reminders and simple habit goals
5) Validate that the plan fits within the day

Output only the final result in this format:
- Schedule (time blocks)
- Reminders (time + purpose)
- Health goals (water/sleep/mood)
- Budget actions (limits or logs)
Keep the output concise and actionable.
```

This approach improves planning quality and coherence (the model “thinks first”) while ensuring users receive clean, final answers without internal chains of reasoning.

## **Tokens and Tokenization**

To ensure efficiency and transparency, DayWise tracks the **number of tokens used in every AI interaction**.  
A **token** is a unit of text (such as a word or part of a word) that the AI model processes. Monitoring token usage is crucial because it directly impacts API costs, response limits, and system performance.

**How it works in DayWise:**

- After each request to the AI API, the backend calculates and logs the **number of tokens in the prompt** before sending it to the model.
- The token count is printed to the console/terminal for every API call, allowing developers to monitor and optimize prompt sizes.
- This process helps prevent exceeding model token limits and keeps the application cost-effective.

**Benefits of Token Logging:**

* **Cost Tracking:** Understand and control API usage costs, as most AI providers charge per token.
* **Prompt Debugging:** Quickly identify if prompts are too long or inefficient, which can cause errors or increased latency.
* **System Optimization:** Fine-tune prompts to maximize information within token limits, ensuring fast and relevant responses.

By actively monitoring token usage, DayWise remains **scalable, reliable, and optimized** for real-world deployment, providing users with a seamless and cost
